# segmnetation-from-classification
This repository implements a segmentation procedure based in classification task

Well, it didn't work. TBH I think classification loss alone is too little of a feedback information to actually acquire a good segmentation map.
Might come back to this project in the future, for now I'll leave it be, existing in the matrix.
